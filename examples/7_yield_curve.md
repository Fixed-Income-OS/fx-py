# Yield Curve

The graph showing the yield to maturity on securities of the same credit risk and different maturity is called
the yield curve.

The yield curve is constructed from the maturity and yield of Treasury securities because treasuries depict 
the effect of maturity alone on yield. This is because treasury securities are perceived to be of the lowest credit
risk possible.
