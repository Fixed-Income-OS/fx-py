where:

C(t) = Net cash flow during the period t
C(0) = Total initial investment costs
IRR = The internal rate of return
t = The number of time periods

```python
from classes.Internal_Rate_Return import InternalRateReturn

price = 7704
cash_flow = [2000, 2000, 2500, 4000]
sample = InternalRateReturn(-price, cash_flow)
sample.calculate() # Should be 12%
```
