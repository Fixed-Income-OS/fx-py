# BOND BASICS

## Defining a bond

A bond is a loan. A corporation or government body (usually termed as "borrowers") asks for money / raise capital by issuing a bond
to the investor who lend the money. Hence the term "issuers"

The bond issuer gets into legal agreement to repay the original borrowed amount (principal) with interest (coupon) after a
set period of time (maturity)
